# Getting Started with MallenniumDash

A quick guide for someone new: instructions and a super simple setup.

---

## Instructions (What You Need)

- **A web browser** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge).
- **An account** — sign in with the method the app provides (e.g. email or Replit Auth).
- **Access** — either add a payment card for the 3-day free trial, or use an access code if you have one.
- **Optional:** An OpenAI API key if you want to use HunterAI (ask your dashboard questions) or the AI Widget Builder (create custom widgets from a description). You can skip this and still use everything else.

That’s it. No install, no desktop app — it runs in the browser.

## Super Simple Setup (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Open the app and sign in

- Go to the app URL (e.g. your Replit or production link).
- Click **Sign in** / **Start Free Trial** (or the main sign-in button).
- Complete sign-in with the method shown (e.g. email or Replit).

### Step 2: Get access (trial or code)

- If you see a **Pricing** or **Choose a plan** screen:
  - **Option A — Free trial:** Click **Add card & start trial**, pick Monthly or Yearly, enter your card. You won’t be charged until after the 3-day trial.
  - **Option B — Access code:** If someone gave you a code, enter it in the “Have an access code?” box and click **Redeem**.
- When access is active, you’ll land on your **dashboard** (a grid with one empty desktop).

### Step 3: Create your first dashboard (easiest way)

- Click **Add Widget** (or the **+** / “Add” button).
- Find **“Build Your Own Widget with AI”** or **Template Library**.
- Open **Template Library** and start the **Setup Wizard**:
  1. **Choose your role** (e.g. Content Creator, Freelancer, Sales, General Solopreneur).
  2. **Choose your priorities** (e.g. revenue, clients, tasks, habits, time).
  3. **Choose tools you want** (e.g. timer, focus mode, expenses, CRM).
  4. Click **Generate** (or **Create my dashboard**).
- The app creates a new desktop with widgets already added and arranged. You’re done with basic setup.

### Step 4: Use it day to day

- **Switch workspaces:** Use the desktop tabs at the top (e.g. “Content Creator Dashboard”, “Desktop 2”).
- **Add more widgets:** **Add Widget** → pick a type (Notes, Priorities, Revenue, Timer, etc.) or use **Build with AI** for a custom widget.
- **Move and resize:** Drag widget titles to move; drag edges/corners to resize.
- **Change colors:** Use the **palette** icon on a widget to change its card color; use the desktop tab area to change the **background** of the whole workspace.
- **Focus mode:** Add a **Context Mode** widget, set an objective and top 3 actions, and optionally turn on the “exit guard” in settings so you’re prompted before switching away.

### Step 5 (optional): Turn on AI features

- Open **Settings** (gear icon).
- If you want **HunterAI** (ask your dashboard questions in plain English) or **AI Widget Builder** (describe a widget, get code):
  - Paste your **OpenAI API key** in the field and save.
  - You can get a key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
- No API key? You can still use the **Setup Wizard**, all 19+ widgets, Timer, Notes, CRM, etc. — only the “ask your data” and “build widget from description” features need the key.
